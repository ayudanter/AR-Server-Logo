# Server Logo Script
With this resource players can see the Logo on the top right of there screen. The logo can be changed by simply replaces the file.

## Description:
1. There are already tons of scripts like this out so what makes this one different? With this script whenever you open your pause menu the logo disappears and whenever you close out of it, the logo reappears. Other Logo scripts this doesn't happen which makes it difficult to see your map and the name of the blips because the logo is covering it.
